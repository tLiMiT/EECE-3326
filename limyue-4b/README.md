Part b

Complete your program that solves Sudoku puzzles. Your algorithm should be based on
recursion.

Your algorithm should read each board from the text file, solve it, print the solution, and
print the number of recursive iterations needed to solve that board. After all boards have
been solved, print the average number of recursive calls needed to solve all the boards.

Your algorithm should minimize the average number of recursive calls needed to solve all
the boards. Try to reduce this value to below 50,000.
