Part b
Reduce the runtime of your solution to the word search puzzle by using the binarySearch
algorithm to search the dictionary for a word.
The binarySearch algorithm requires that the list of words be in sorted order. Implement
two sorting algorithms and compare their runtimes. One of the sorting algorithms you
implement should be quicksort.
You should turn in a working program based on whichever sorting algorithm is faster. The
other algorithm should be implemented but not called within your code.
